# üìÉ About
A project for those who seek to study with more focus, using the Pomodoro method. Meanwhile, there's a lo-fi song, in the background, to help with concentration and stay focused on the process.

## ü§∑ Why
I did this project when i needed a **Pomodoro Timer** and efficient one, and  since i'm learning front-end, i decided to give it a try and here is the result.
